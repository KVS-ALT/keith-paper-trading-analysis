# keith-paper-trading-analysis
This project analyzes my own papertrading stock trading history to track investment patterns and passive income. It processes raw CSV data to calculate total capital committed, broker fees, and dividend yields. The analysis includes visualizations of portfolio distribution and a timeline of cash flow to show how the account has grown over time.
